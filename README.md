# Powers Lab UI
> Component library for tasks

This is a storybook repo containing the component library for tasks.

Currently it contains:
- Button
- Checkers
- Instructions (A component for presenting nice instructions)
- Stripes

This is a great starting place for a new developer in the lab to consider what components are common and useful in a task, and isolate them as individual components.

Eventually, it would be really great to create a drag-and-drop builder so the lab can quickly create tasks.

To get started, install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

To open up the storybook, run:

```bash
yarn run storybook
```
